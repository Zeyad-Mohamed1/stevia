# Stevia E-commerce Template

This is a Next.js e-commerce template with support for multiple languages and product variants.

## Recent Improvements

### Color and Size Selection Fix

I've fixed the color and size selection functionality in the product details page. The improvements include:

#### 1. Enhanced State Management

- **Proper initialization**: Colors and sizes are now initialized with proper fallbacks
- **Dynamic updates**: State updates correctly when products change
- **Null safety**: Components handle cases where no colors or sizes are available

#### 2. Improved Data Normalization

- **Flexible data structures**: Supports different color/size data formats
- **Cart compatibility**: Normalizes data before sending to cart
- **Consistent handling**: Ensures proper data flow throughout the application

#### 3. Better User Experience

- **Conditional rendering**: Color/size selectors only appear when options are available
- **Visual feedback**: Proper active states and tooltips
- **Translation support**: Proper multilingual support for selection labels

#### 4. Cart Integration

- **Proper variant handling**: Cart correctly stores and displays selected colors/sizes
- **Unique cart IDs**: Prevents conflicts between same products with different variants
- **API compatibility**: Normalized data is correctly sent to the backend

#### Key Changes Made:

1. **Details1.jsx**:

   - Added proper state initialization with fallbacks
   - Implemented data normalization for cart
   - Added conditional rendering for color/size selectors
   - Improved cart integration with proper variant handling

2. **ColorSelect.jsx**:

   - Enhanced to handle different color data structures
   - Added proper null checking and fallbacks
   - Improved visual styling for better UX

3. **SizeSelect.jsx**:

   - Enhanced to handle different size data structures
   - Added proper null checking and fallbacks
   - Improved active state management

4. **Context.jsx**:

   - Improved data normalization for cart storage
   - Better handling of different data structures
   - Enhanced compatibility with API

5. **Translation files**:
   - Added missing translation keys for "Select Color" and "Select Size"

#### Usage:

The color and size selection now works seamlessly with:

- Products with colors and sizes
- Products with only colors
- Products with only sizes
- Products with neither (won't show selectors)

The selected variants are properly stored in the cart and sent to the backend API with the correct format.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
